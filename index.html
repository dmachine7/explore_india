      <h1 class="articlehead">INDIA AT A GLANCE.</h1>
      <p class="article">India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8° 4' and 37° 6' north, longitudes 68° 7' and 97° 25' east and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier of about 15,200 km. The total length of the coastline of the mainland, Lakshadweep Islands and Andaman & Nicobar Islands is 7,516.6 km.

      <h1 class="articlehead" id="geo">GEOGRAPHY.</h1>
      <p class="article">
        The mainland comprises four regions, namely, the great mountain zone, plains of the Ganga and the Indus, the desert region and the southern peninsula.
        The Himalayas comprise three almost parallel ranges interspersed with large plateaus and valleys, some of which, like the Kashmir and Kullu valleys, are fertile, extensive and of great scenic beauty. Some of the highest peaks in the world are found in these ranges. The high altitudes admit travel only to a few passes, notably the Jelep La and Nathu La on the main Indo-Tibet trade route through the Chumbi Valley, north-east of Darjeeling and Shipki La in the Satluj valley, north-east of Kalpa (Kinnaur). The mountain wall extends over a distance of about 2,400 km with a varying depth of 240 to 320 km. In the east, between India and Myanmar and India and Bangladesh, hill ranges are much lower. Garo, Khasi, Jaintia and Naga Hills, running almost east-west, join the chain to Mizo and Rkhine Hills running north-south.
        The plains of the Ganga and the Indus, about 2,400 km long and 240 to 320 km broad, are formed by basins of three distinct river systems - the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. They are one of the world's greatest stretches of flat alluvium and also one of the most densely populated areas on the earth. Between the Yamuna at Delhi and the Bay of Bengal, nearly 1,600 km away, there is a drop of only 200 metres in elevation.
        The desert region can be divided into two parts - the great desert and the little desert. The great desert extends from the edge of the Rann of Kuchch beyond the Luni River northward. The whole of the Rajasthan-Sind frontier runs through this. The little desert extends from the Luni between Jaisalmer and Jodhpur up to the northern wastes. Between the great and the little deserts lies a zone of absolutely sterile country, consisting of rocky land cut up by limestone ridges.
        The Peninsular Plateau is marked off from the plains of the Ganga and the Indus by a mass of mountain and hill ranges varying from 460 to 1,220 metres in height. Prominent among these are the Aravalli, Vindhya, Satpura, Maikala and Ajanta. The Peninsula is flanked on the one side by the Eastern Ghats where average elevation is about 610 metres and on the other by the Western Ghats where it is generally from 915 to 1,220 metres, rising in places to over 2,440 metres. Between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea lies a narrow coastal strip, while between Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal there is a broader coastal area. The southern point of plateau is formed by the Nilgiri Hills where the Eastern and the Western Ghats meet. The Cardamom Hills lying beyond may be regarded as a continuation of the Western Ghats.
        The climate of India may be broadly described as tropical monsoon type.

              <h1 class="articlehead" id="flora">FLORA & FAUNA.</h1>
              <p class="article">
                The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), with its headquarters in Kolkata and 16 regional stations is responsible for surveying the faunal resources of India. Possessing a tremendous diversity of climate and physical conditions, India has great variety of fauna, numbering 89,451 species, which include protista, mollusca, anthropoda, amphibia, mammalia, reptilia, members of protochordata, pisces, aves and other invertebrates.
        The mammals include the majestic elephant, the gaur or Indian bison - the largest of existing bovines, the great Indian rhinoceros, the gigantic wild sheep of the Himalayas, the swamp deer, the thamin spotted deer, nilgai, the four-horned antelope, the Indian antelope or black-buck - the only representatives of these genera. Among the cats, the tiger and lion are the most magnificent of all; other splendid creatures such as the clouded leopard, the snow leopard, the marbled cat, etc., are also found. Many other species of mammals are remarkable for their beauty, colouring, grace and uniqueness. Several birds, like pheasants, geese, ducks, mynahs, parakeets, pigeons, cranes, hornbills and sun birds inhabit forests and wetlands.
        Rivers and lakes harbour crocodiles and gharials, the latter being the only representative of crocodilian order in the world. The salt-water crocodile is found along the eastern coast and in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. A project for breeding crocodiles, started in 1974, has been instrumental in saving the crocodile from extinction.
        The great Himalayan range has a very interesting variety of fauna that includes the wild sheep and goats, markhor, ibex, shrew and tapir. The panda and the snow leopard are found in the upper reaches of the mountains.
        Depletion of vegetative cover due to expansion of agriculture, habitat destruction, over-exploitation, pollution, introduction of toxic imbalance in community structure, epidemics, floods, droughts and cyclones, contribute to the loss of flora and fauna. More than 39 species of mammals, 72 species of birds, 17 species of reptiles, three species of amphibians, two species of fish, and a large number of butterflies, moth, and beetles are considered vulnerable and endangered.
        With a wide range of climatic conditions from the torrid to the arctic, India has a rich and varied vegetation, which only a few countries of comparable size possess. India can be divided into eight distinct-floristic-regions, namely, the western Himalayas, the eastern Himalayas, Assam, the Indus plain, the Ganga plain, the Deccan, Malabar and the Andamans.
        The Western Himalayan region extends from Kashmir to Kumaon. Its temperate zone is rich in forests of chir, pine, other conifers and broad-leaved temperate trees. Higher up, forests of deodar, blue pine, spruce and silver fir occur. The alpine zone extends from the upper limit of the temperate zone of about 4,750 metres or even higher. The characteristic trees of this zone are high-level silver fir, silver birch and junipers. The eastern Himalayan region extends from Sikkim eastwards and embraces Darjeeling, Kurseong and the adjacent tract. The temperate zone has forests of oaks, laurels, maples, rhododendrons, alder and birch. Many conifers, junipers and dwarf willows also occur here. The Assam region comprises the Brahmaputra and the Surma valleys with evergreen forests, occasional thick clumps of bamboos and tall grasses. The Indus plain region comprises the plains of Punjab, western Rajasthan and northern Gujarat. It is dry and hot and supports natural vegetation. The Ganga plain region covers the area which is alluvial plain and is under cultivation for wheat, sugarcane and rice. Only small areas support forests of widely differing types. The Deccan region comprises the entire tableland of the Indian Peninsula and supports vegetation of various kinds from scrub jungles to mixed deciduous forests. The Malabar region covers the excessively humid belt of mountain country parallel to the west coast of the Peninsula. Besides being rich in forest vegetation, this region produces important commercial crops, such as coconut, betel nut, pepper, coffee and tea, rubber and cashew nut. The Andaman region abounds in evergreen, mangrove, beach and diluvia forests. The Himalayan region extending from Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh through Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, Meghalaya and Nagaland and the Deccan Peninsula is rich in endemic flora, with a large number of plants which are not found elsewhere.
        Owing to destruction of forests for agricultural, industrial and urban development, several Indian plants are facing extinction. About 1,336 plant species are considered vulnerable and endangered. About 20 species of higher plants are categorised as possibly extinct as these have not been sighted during the last 6-10 decades.

      <p class="article">
        <br><br><strong>INDIAN CULTURE</strong><br><br>
        India is a country that boasts of a rich culture. The culture of India refers to a collection of minor unique cultures. The culture of India comprises of clothing, festivals, languages, religions, music, dance, architecture, food, and art in India. Most noteworthy, Indian culture has been influenced by several foreign cultures throughout its history. Also, the history of India’s culture is several millennia old.
        <br><br><strong>Components of Indian Culture</strong>  <br><br>
        First of all, Indian origin religions are Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. All of these religions are based on karma and dharma. Furthermore, these four are called as Indian religions. Indian religions are a major category of world religions along with Abrahamic religions.
        Also, many foreign religions are present in India as well. These foreign religions include Abrahamic religions. The Abrahamic religions in India certainly are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Besides Abrahamic religions, Zoroastrianism and Bahá’í Faith are the other foreign religions which exist in India. Consequently, the presence of so many diverse religions has given rise to tolerance and secularism in Indian culture.
        The Joint family system is the prevailing system of Indian culture. Most noteworthy, the family members consist of parents, children, children’s spouses, and offspring. All of these family members live together. Furthermore, the eldest male member is the head of the family.
        Arranged marriages are the norm in Indian culture. Probably most Indians have their marriages planned by their parents. In almost all Indian marriages, the bride’s family gives dowry to bridegroom. Weddings are certainly festive occasions in Indian culture. There is involvement of striking decorations, clothing, music, dance, rituals in Indian weddings. Most noteworthy, the divorce rates in India are very low.
        India celebrates a huge number of festivals. These festivals are very diverse due to multi-religious and multi-cultural Indian society. Indians greatly value festive occasions. Above all, the whole country joins in the celebrations irrespective of the differences.
        Traditional Indian food, arts, music, sports, clothing, and architecture vary significantly across different regions. These components are influenced by various factors. Above all, these factors are geography, climate, culture, and rural/urban setting.
        <br><br><strong>Festivals</strong><br><br>
        India, being a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society, celebrates holidays and festivals of various religions. Major festivals include Diwali, Durga puja, Holi, Ganesh puja, Navratri, Rath yatra, Christmas , Ramadan,Id etc are there round the year.
        <br><br><strong>Food</strong><br><br>
        Indian food is a cosmopolitan cuisine that has so many ingredients. It is as diverse as India. Indian recipes use numerous ingredients, deploy a wide range of food preparation styles, cooking techniques, and culinary presentation. Thus the tastes of same food like salads, sauces, vegetables, meat, desserts vary from region to region. Well most famous being chhole bhature, pani puri , dosa , idli , jalebi and samosa.
        <br><br> <strong>Perceptions of Indian Culture</strong><br><br>
        Indian culture has been an inspiration to many writers. India is certainly a symbol of unity around the world. Indian culture is certainly very complex. Furthermore, the conception of Indian identity poses certain difficulties. However, despite this, a typical Indian culture does exist. The creation of this typical Indian culture results from some internal forces. Above all, these forces are a robust Constitution, universal adult franchise, secular policy, flexible federal structure, etc.
        Indian culture is characterized by a strict social hierarchy. Furthermore, Indian children are taught their roles and place in society from an early age. Probably, many Indians believe that gods and spirits have a role in determining their life. Earlier, traditional Hindus were divided into polluting and non-polluting occupations. Now, this difference is declining.
        Indian culture is certainly very diverse. Also, Indian children learn and assimilate in the differences. In recent decades, huge changes have taken place in Indian culture. Above all, these changes are female empowerment, westernization, a decline of superstition, higher literacy, improved education, etc.
        To sum it up, the culture of India is one of the oldest cultures in the World. Above all, many Indians till stick to the traditional Indian culture in spite of rapid westernization. Indians have demonstrated strong unity irrespective of the diversity among them. Unity in Diversity is the ultimate mantra of Indian culture.

      <br><br>  <br><br><strong>INDIAN HERITAGE</strong><br><br>
        Heritage means what we inherit from our ancestors and from our past. India is a land of varied cultures and traditions. People from numerous castes, religions, and creeds reside in our country. Each ethnic group in our country has its own tale of origin and its set of unique traditions and culture. They have all contributed to the making of Indian history and culture. Nature has made India into a distinct geographical entity.
          <br><br><strong>Indian Heritage: A gift from older generation</strong><br><br>
        Indian heritage and culture are vast and vivid because of the large number of religious groups residing in our country. Every community has its own set of customs and traditions which it passes on to its younger generation.
        However, some of our customs and traditions remain the same throughout IndiaOur traditions teach us to inculcate good habits and make us a good human being. Our cultural heritage is thus a beautiful gift from our older generation that will help us become a better human being and build a harmonious society.

        <br><br><strong>Respect for our heritage</strong><br><br>
        The elders should take responsibility to invoke love for the Indian heritage in the younger generations. This must be done from the very beginning only then we can preserve our rich heritage. It is the duty of the elders to invoke love for the Indian heritage in the younger generations.
        This must be done from the very beginning only then we can preserve our rich heritage. Schools must teach students about Indian heritage and how it has survived for centuries. They must also share the importance of preserving it. This would help in invoking a feeling of pride in them and they would be inspired to continue the tradition and also pass it on to the new generation. This needs a collective effort by the teachers as well as parents.

        <br><br><strong>Our Literature</strong><br><br>
        Indian literature is as rich as its culture. We have various books written on many topics since ancient times. We have the Vedic literature, epic Sanskrit literature, Classic Sanskrit literature and Pali literature among other kinds of Indian literature. Many of our books are being translated to other languages to provide access to a greater number of readers so that more and people can benefit from the knowledge. Such a wonderful and rich literature must be preserved at any cost.
        <br><br><strong>Beautiful Geological Structures</strong><br><br>
        Numerous beautiful geological structures found in different parts of India. Best of the splendid geological structures that form a part of our country include Lonar Crater Lake, Siachen Glacier, Jammu and Kashmir, Pillar Rocks, Kodaikanal, Barren Island, Andamans, Magnetic Hill, Leh, Columnar Basaltic Lava, Udupi, and Toad Rock. All these structures are true wonders of nature. A lot of tourists every year from around the world especially visit these places just to catch a glimpse of these marvelous creations of God
        <br><br><strong>UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites in India</strong><br><br>
        The below geological places have been enlisted in UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites. These sites include:<br><br>

      <h1 class="articlehead">ANCIENT VS MODERN INDIA.</h1>
      <p class="article">Ancient India was a country of considerable educational development, with universities that attracted many foreign students.  Asians, especially the Chinese, were attracted to Indian universities, because they offered instruction in the teachings of Buddha.  India also would increase their educational influence by sending its university graduates to the orient to teach.  However, from the 13th century and on the original contribution of the Indians weakened, and application of newer educational methods was reduced.  Since gaining its independence from Great Britain, India has tried to develop a modern and complete school system.  However, the problem of educating the vast population with its many social and religious differences has remained difficult.
      Most of the time funds that otherwise would have been used for education have to be used to fight the problems of poverty, food shortages and overpopulation <br><br>
      Few countries in the world have such an ancient and diverse culture as India's. India's physical, religious and racial variety is as important as the history of how it becomes what "Modern India." In India, religion is very important to the people.  It is a major part of the entire Indian tradition. For the majority of Indians, religion takes over every aspect of life, from common place daily chores to education and politics.
      The women were worshipped in ancient India but sadly I cannot say this for current situation of women in Modern India. But women is now making progress, thanks to government reforms and changing mentality. For any nation it is important that every section of society be treated equally and given equal opportunities, hence it is important to note
      that ill-practices like caste system, untouchability which prevailed in ancient India are now being eradicated from our systems.<br><br>
      I'm in no doubt when I say India was the most scientifically and technologically advanced nation in the past. The important medical procedure of surgery was first invented here
      and Ayurveda is one of the oldest and prominent medical procedures still in practice. Legends say that our Vedas contain the knowledge of quantum physics anf if studied thoroughly might give solutions to may prevailing problems.
      Aryabhatta , the mathematician gifted the world ZERO [0]. But today we might not be the best as we used to be. <br><br>
      The moral education , the literature, the food culture , the clothing and art forms might have suffered a blow from westernization in modern India but it is also true that we , from generation to generations , are passing these on as our heritage and tradition.<br><br>
      India was called "SONE KI CHIDIYA" [Golden Bird] in ancient times but from time to time , with hypocrite and corrupt leaders , the greedy invaders ,
      orthodox mentality , poverty and illiteracy , the country has suffered a lot. I wish and hope for the betterment of my nation , for that citizens and the government must go hand in hand.

      <h1 class="articlehead">RURAL INDIA & RURAL LIFE.</h1>
      <p class="article">
          One fact of which we are all made aware is that India is an agricultural country. This means that the majority of the population practices agriculture either for self-sustenance or as a commercial activity. So there are far more villages and small towns in India that cities and metros. In fact, as per the last census two-thirds of the Indian population still lives in rural areas. The life of a villager and the environment of a village are distinctly different than the urban environment we grow up in. Let us explore this further in this article on Life in an Indian Village.<br><br>
          <strong>The Farmer Life</strong><br><br>
        Farming and agriculture are one of the most difficult jobs. The Indian farmer, in particular, is a hardworking and diligent man. The land and the crops need close attention and efforts day and night for a successful harvest. Life in an Indian village is not a walk in the park by any means.
        The farmer will usually start his day before sunup and work throughout the whole day. It involves a lot of manual labor and persistence. They plow the land, sow the seeds, harvest the crops, etc. And a lot of the farmers do not enjoy the luxury of machines or tractors and have to rely on intense manual labor. Rain or shine, they can never take a day off.
        And even after all these efforts and sacrifices, the financial conditions of farmers in India remains dire. The rising costs of living, frequent crop failures due to climate changes, insufficient support from the government and many other factors are contributing to their mistreatment. India in fact also faces the shameful problem of rising farmer suicides as well.
        <br><br> <strong>Infrastructure and Environment in Villages</strong><br><br>
        As one can imagine, villages are far less congested and polluted than cities. Due to lack of urbanization, they are able to main their natural habitat and environment to a large extent. There is a green cover around the village and overall a calm, clean and beautiful environment. Generally, there is also a water source close by, like a lake or river.
        One disadvantage of living in an Indian village is the lack of infrastructure that plagues. Although, since independence, our government has made many efforts to provide these villages with basic infrastructure facilities, we have a long way to go still.
        The houses of the villagers are usually made of thatched roofs and mud or clay. These are not permanent structures. There is maybe one school and one hospital shared among 3-4 small villages and usually involves a long commute. The roadways are not well maintained and usually not well connected either. Transportation facilities are also generally lacking and inadequate.
        <br><br> <strong>Cultural Life in Villages</strong><br><br>
        The village life, however, is not all work and no play. Villagers often gather for festivals, fairs, harvests, and other religious and cultural functions. Indian villages have a rich history of culture and tradition. Art is celebrated in the form of dance, songs, plays, etc. In fact, some of our most famous dance forms and songs come to us from these traditions practiced in various villages from India.

      <h1 class="articlehead">SPORTS IN INDIA.</h1>
      <p class="article">
        The history of Indian sports is believed to be 8000 years old, from the time of Indus Valley civilization. Many pieces of evidence suggest that the people played an early form of chess and invented dice. The existence of seals recovered from the sites of Indus valley and other artefacts also prove the fact that hunting and boxing were practised then. During the Vedic India , the men of stature and circumstance got competent with each other in chariot-racing, archery, horsemanship, military tactics, wrestling, weight-lifting, swimming and hunting. Buddhism leader, Gautama Buddha, himself was a pro at Archery and Hammer-Throwing. Manas-Olhas, a classic written by Chalukya 850 years ago, mentioned about Mallakhamb. Mughals were an avid fan of the game of polo and when they came to India they brought the game with them which became popular with many royalties. Not just polo, but the kings also embraced wrestling and boxers as a sport. One of the greatest personalities of India, Swami Vivekananda once said, “You will be nearer to Heaven through football than through the study of the Gita.” In 1721 AD, a bunch of British sailors decided to play a game of cricket on India’s western seaboard, Cambay. Cricket became the first English sport introduced in India. Our elites used to learn cricket in schools before the independence era and the grassroots audience used to replicate it turning the game into religion now. It is said in India that <strong>“Cricket is our religion and  SACHIN TENDULKAR is our god”</strong>. Mohun Bagan, the oldest football club, was established in 1889 AD. It grew from strength to strength after 1911 when Bengal crowd reacted to British jibes in a physical culture movement. This lead to a win in the Indian Football Association final. In the 20th century, India emerged as a Hockey superpower. From its Olympic debut in 1928, the Indian Hockey team went on dominate the competition for close to 6 decades, winning gold on 8 occasions. India is the only team to have won 6 consecutive Olympic gold medals. The team scored a massive 178 goals during this phase while conceding only 7 goals. No other team in the world has managed to come even close to rivalling such dominance. In the latter part of the century, however, the downfall of hockey almost coincided with the rise of cricket in India. India won its last Olympic medal, a Gold, in 1980. Three years later, the cricket fever took over the entire nation when Kapil Dev famously lifted the 1983 World Cup (then known as the Prudential Cup ’83) in the Lord’s stadium. It would be safe to say that the fever still exists, with the better part of the country closely following the Indian National Cricket team. Since 1983 high, the team has gone on to win another World Cup (2011), a T20 World Cup (2007), two Champions trophy (2002,2013) among other honours. The country has also produced cricketing stars like Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev, Anil Kumble, MS Dhoni, and Virat Kohli among others. India has been a world champion at some point in Cricket, Kabbadi, Chess, Hockey, Wrestling, Billiards & Badminton. India is now one of the leading countries in sposrts too with players excelling in badminton, table-tennis, board games, athletics, boxing , shooting and probably all the sports you can think of. Though there still remains a room for improvement in other sports as we have done in cricket.
        <br><br><strong>Emergence of League sports</strong><br><br>
        A major change has been seen in Indian sports since last two decades.  A major catalyst for change has been the private-league culture that was brought about by the Indian Premier League (IPL).
        The IPL model is not only financially rewarding but also a huge fan gatherer. It was thus not surprising to see other organizers applying the same strategy to monetize the respective sports. The Premier Badminton League (PBL), Indian Super League (ISL), and the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) are just a few examples.
        All these have struck gold in terms of attracting crowds, thus the sponsors and ultimately the all-important money. Sports is the ultimate winner here, with the clubs providing all the necessary facilities for development of the youngsters.

      <h1 class="articlehead">SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTS & FIGURES OF INDIA.</h1>
      <p class="article">
        The economy of India is characterised as a developing market economy. It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). According to the IMF, on a per capita income basis, India ranked 139th by GDP (nominal) and 118th by GDP (PPP) in 2018. From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments promoted protectionist economic policies with extensive state intervention and regulation; the end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad program of economic liberalisation. Since the start of the 21st century, annual average GDP growth has been 6% to 7%,and from 2014 to 2018, India was the world's fastest growing major economy, surpassing China. Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century.
      <br><br><strong>Quick facts</strong><br><br>
      POPULATION: 1.3 billion <br><br> GDP (PPP): $10.5 trillion (word rank 3rd) | 7.1% growth in 2018| 5-year compound annual growth 7.6% | $7,874 per capita <br><br>UNEMPLOYMENT: 2.6% <br><br>INFLATION (CPI): 3.5% <br><br>FDI INFLOW: $42.3 billion <br><br>PUBLIC DEBT: 69.8% of GDP <br><br>EASE OF DOING BUSINESS RANK: 63rd <br><br>COUNTRY GROUP: Developing/Emerging
      <br><br><strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong><br><br>
      With 16 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) still far from being achieved, India continues to pursue ambitious targets towards social and economic development and environmental sustainability. Poverty elimination remains a key national objective and has been approached in a relatively comprehensive way through promoting continued economic growth while ensuring equitable access to public services among both the rural and growing urban population.
      The Digital India scheme, along with other initiatives to increase access to finance, will help to meet the needs of a growing consumer class that is projected to reach 89 million households by 2025. India is also investing significantly in its services and industry sectors through the Skill India scheme, which will develop the next generation of highly skilled labour for growth in manufacturing and information and communication technology (ICT). As women make up 48% of the total Indian population but only 24% of the workforce, the Indian government is mainstreaming gender issues into programmes such as Startup India and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) to promote female entrepreneurship.Schemes such as Clean India and Healthcare for All focus on social welfare through the provision of basic sanitation, adequate housing and universal health care. India has also focused on improving agricultural productivity to ensure food security. There are plans to double farmers’ incomes through investments in market linkages, crop diversification and infrastructure development. The Electricity for All programme emphasises India’s commitment to climate action.Goals as named- <br><br>
      <br><br>1.No Poverty  2.Zero Hunger  3.Good Health and Well-Being  4.Quality Education  5.Gender Equality  6.Clean Water and Sanitation  7.Affordable and Clean Energy  8.Decent Work and Economic Growth  9.Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure  10.Reduced Inequalities  11.Sustainable Cities and Communities  12.Responsible Consumption and Production  13.Climate Action  14.Life Below Water  15.Life On Land  16.Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions  17.Partnerships for the Goals

      <h1 class="articlehead">SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA.</h1>
      <p class="article">
        Over the recent past, Science and Technology has made tremendous contribution towards the settlement of industries in India.
        Starting from the micro level to the macro level, research and development in the field of technology has created an ideal niche for the overall growth of the economic condition of the country. The perceptible examples are the development of Atomic Energy, Space Science, dozens of successful satellite systems, advanced medical technologies, etc.
        After the independence, it was not possible for India to depend on other countries for various aspects of development; therefore, the development of indigenous technology was indispensable for the overall development of a country.
        Thankfully, today, Indian technologies and companies are as competent as in other developed countries. India is also a lead in various fields, and is a tough competitor for other countries.
        If we discuss about the skilled human resources, many Indians are at top-notch positions in leading companies.
        Indian industries started flourishing post 1990, i.e., the landmark era. Globalization, liberalization, and privatization, facilitated this growth. The industries catering to Information & Technology, Atomic Energy, Automotive, Biotechnology, Nanotechnology, Pharmaceutical, Petroleum, etc. have increased at global level.
        On the other hand, the Government of India has also made sizable investment in the field of research and development to encourage the advancement of Indian economy.
        <br><br><strong>As numbers suggest</strong><br><br>
        1. The 21st century in India is apparently marked as the beginning towards an advancement in terms of technology and enrichment of knowledge base in the fields of Science. India ranks third among the most attractive investment destinations for technology transactions in the world. Modern India has had a strong focus on science and technology, realising that it is a key element of economic growth.
        <br><br>2. India is among the topmost countries in the world in the field of scientific research, positioned as one of the top five nations in the field of space exploration. The country has regularly undertaken space missions, including missions to the moon and the famed Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
        <br><br>3. India ranks second in terms of contribution to high-quality scientific research.
        <br><br>4. It is among the world’s top 10 nations in the number of scientific publications.
        <br><br>5. Position-wise, it is ranked 17th in the number of citations received and 34th in the number of citations per paper across the field of science and technology (among nations publishing 50,000 or more papers). The country is ranked ninth globally in the number of scientific publications and 12th in the number of patents filed.
        <br><br>6. India has been ranked as the top exporter of information and communication technology (ICT) services and second in innovation quality in 2017#. The country has moved up six places to 60th position in the Global Innovation Index (GII).
